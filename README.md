# Antergos Prime

### This collection of scripts wants to provide GPU-switching for Hybrid-GPUs like in \*buntu-distributions for Antergos.

This is a fork of: https://github.com/Antergos/antergos-prime

which is in turn forks of:
This is a fork of konstantingoretzki's [AntergosPrime](https://github.com/konstantingoretzki/AntergosPrime) repository which in turn is a fork of emanuellopes's one [archLinuxPrime](https://github.com/emanuellopes/archLinuxPrime) which got optimized for the Antergos distribution.

We removed the prime-indicator app as it was not working anymore.

The main work of this script goes to Emanuellopes and the Linux-Mint-team, konstantingoretzki optimized some paths, updated package names, added how to fix the tearing for the Nvidia-GPU and put everything well described together, so that even people with less bash skills can (hopefully) easily follow on how to install and use AntergosPrime.

Even if this branch is made for Antergos, the installation-instructions are mostly system-independent and should therefore work with any Arch-distribution.

If you want to install this manually, go to konstantingoretzki's fork and read his readme file: [AntergosPrime](https://github.com/konstantingoretzki/AntergosPrime)

Basically I just wanted to use gdm instead of sddm, so installation goes something like this:

sudo pacman -S nvidia bbswitch gdm

sudo systemctl disable lightdm

sudo systemctl enable gdm

sudo ./install.sh

sudo prime-select nvidia

sudo prime-select intel
